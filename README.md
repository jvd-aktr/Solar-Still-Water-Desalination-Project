# Background
This project involves harnessing concentrated sunlight to facilitate water desalination within a solar still. An experimental arrangement was constructed to examine the water yield, incorporating a heliostat array and a solar still basin. Additionally, an autonomous control system, based on Arduino, was devised to manage a set of dual-axis heliostats for sunlight concentration.

A Journal Paper and a Conference paper have already been published. The links for which are shown below:
